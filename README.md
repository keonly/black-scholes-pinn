# Solving Black-Scholes Equation with PINNs

Black-Scholes equation was a revolutionary discovery in the field of finance.
Through this partial differential equation, the ratio of how the price change of the
option relates to the price change of the underlying asset was able to be calculated.
In this project, physics-informed neural networks(PINNs) was used to derive the
numerical solutions for the Black-Sholes equation pricing European options.
